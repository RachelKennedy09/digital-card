 ## what I learned
React app structure: index.html (root), main.jsx (mounts React), App.jsx (component tree), index.css (global styles).

When to use /public vs /src for images (static vs imported, bundler-managed).

JSX differences from HTML: className, semantic elements like <main>, headings, alt text.

Styling patterns: CSS variables, object-fit for hero images, focus-visible for a11y.

Git habits: early init, small commits, clear messages, pushing to GitHub.

## Wins

Built a clean, responsive card with semantic HTML and a11y focus.

Practiced Trello → small steps → accept criteria mindset.

Set up Git/GitHub like a real project.

## Challenges

Remembering className vs class in JSX.

Understanding /public vs /src assets.

Getting comfortable with Vite’s dev server and file structure.

## Next time

Split sections into components.

Add icons + brand palette.

Deploy to GitHub Pages.
